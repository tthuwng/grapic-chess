## Reflection

It's quite a fun journey when I had chance to build the whole little game from ground up. I was able to learn more about how chess work under the hood. The hardest part is when I needed to figure out the algorithms of the rules to handle all the chess pieces' moves and special case (pawn promotion, enpassant)
